                <h2>me</h2>
                <p>This website was made by a nerdy and bored high school student. I spend most of my time programming and learning. Inside and outside of school.</p>
                <p>My hobbies are music production and programming.</p>
                <p>I used to play Minecraft and other games, but I don't play very many games anymore.</p>
                <p>I love Arch Linux. I am a huge privacy nerd, and just like a nerd in general. Or at least that's what my friends tell me.</p>
                <p>I'm thinking about working in cybersecurity or web development. I might start a IT business though.</p>

                <h2>this website</h2>
                <p>I've had this website for almost a year. Been hosted on places like InfinityFree and Github. Been mostly hosted on Github.</p>
                <p>I have all the code on Github currently. My domain was also provied partially by Github.</p>
                <p>I am a student, so I took advantage of the Github Education Pack and NameCheap gave me a free domain for being a student.</p>
                <p>The domain is protected and managed by Cloudflare.</p>
                <p>Cloudflare also builds and publishes my website. I use the Cloudflare Pages feature in Cloudflare to deploy my website</p>
