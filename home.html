                <h2>about</h2>
                <p>This website was made by a nerdy and bored high school student. I spend most of my time programming and learning. Inside and outside of school.</p>
                <p>My hobbies are music and programming. I used to play Minecraft and other games, but I don't play very many games anymore.</p>
                <a href="pages/content/about">Read more about me and this website here</a>
                <h2>webrings</h2>
                <p>Webrings are some cool things. It's like a small internet of people's websites linked together, in a ring!</p>
                <p>I have joined quite a few of them, and most of them I find really interesting!</p>
                <p>If you wanna check some out and meet my neighbors, <a href="/pages/off-site/rings">click here!</a></p>
                <h2>drawings</h2>
                <p>I wanna know the people that come onto my website better, and a fun and interesting way to do that is by the things the peoples draw!</p>
                <p>So I made a page dedicated on my website just for the drawings my people have made! Anyone can put something on there, and they can look at it too!</p>
                <p>Just email me, listed on my socials or on the page itself.</p>
                <p>Check out the area over <a href="/pages/community/drawings">here!</a></p>
